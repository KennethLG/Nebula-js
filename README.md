components/: This folder is where you can store reusable game components. Components are self-contained, modular pieces of functionality that can be used throughout your game. For example, you might have components for player characters, enemies, items, UI elements, or other game objects.

entities/: The entities folder can contain domain-specific entities or data structures that represent the core concepts of your game. These entities are often agnostic to the game's presentation layer and focus on defining the game's core logic and rules.

scenes/: In the scenes folder, you can organize the various scenes or levels of your game. Each scene represents a specific gameplay environment or part of your game. Scenes may contain the logic for loading assets, managing game objects, and controlling transitions between levels.

system/: The system folder is where you can place more general or cross-cutting concerns, such as game systems, managers, services, and utilities. This folder can contain code responsible for handling input, physics, sound, or any other systems that are shared among multiple game components or scenes.
